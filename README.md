### Assignment
You are now ready to begin assessing your data and build initial models. Randall Cunningham would like you to build decision trees. Your new assignment requires you to build classification trees and regression trees. Use the data file [calihospital.txt](/data/calihospital.txt) for this assignment. 

Decide on the predictor variables you use for these analyses.
* Using `operating income` as a target variable, create a tree (1 pt.)
* Using `operating revenue` as a target variable, create a tree (1 pt.)
* Using `TypeControl` as a target variable, create a tree (1 pt.)
* Using `DonorType` as a target variable, create a tree (1 pt.)

Now that you have built several different trees, you need to assess each one.
* Interpret your findings for these trees. That is, don't just repeat the English rules found in your splits. Explain why you think the splits you received make sense. (4 pts.)
* Which of these trees would you choose as your best model? Justify your position. (Note, you do not have to use an objective assessment, such as scoring predicted values, due to the small sample size.) (2 pts.)
